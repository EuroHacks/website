		<FAQ 
			question = " What is a hackathon? "
			answer = " Hackathon is when many people interested in coding/robotics and generally computer science for 1 or more days in order to create amazing project but more importantly meet new people and learn new things. All of these combined with amazing venues, food, drinks and good attitude make up a wonderful experience and an unforgetable coding event."> 
		</FAQ>
