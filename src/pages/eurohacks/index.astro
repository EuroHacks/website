            <p class="text-4xl my-3 mx-10 text-justify"> After some years in the Hack Club community and after we participated in many smaller and bigger events we found out that there is an issue...there are no enough Hack Club hackathons in Europe. So we decided to take care of the issue by organizing Eurohacks. We hope that this event will be the first event of a series of events in Europe organized by Hack Club. (I will write some more things tmr)
