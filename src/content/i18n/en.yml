  The website is currently under construction. Most parts of it are working. However, there might 
  be some false information as well as many blank parts because of the lack of information that 
  we currently have as it is very early in the organizing process. Also as translating the whole 
  website in 7 different languages is a difficult process some translations might be off or not 
  existing. We would advise you to switch to English for the best experience. (the issues will 
  be resolved pretty soon).

      title: Why do we want to organize EuroHacks?
      text: >
        <br> Hack Club is an esteemed organization that brings together high school students from across the globe who share a 
        deep passion for creation and innovation. Within Hack Club, a diverse group of individuals - ranging from organizers, 
        coders, and hackers to painters, engineers, musicians, writers, and volunteers - unite to foster a dynamic community. 
        This collaborative spirit is exemplified not only through the Hack Club Slack, where members engage and connect but 
        also through hackathons.

        <br><br> Hackathons serve as an exceptional platform to gather individuals with a common enthusiasm for coding and 
        creativity. They offer a unique space for collaboration, learning, and technological innovation while strengthening 
        bonds within the Hack Club community.

        <br><br> However, despite Hack Club’s global presence, no hackathons are currently being held in Europe, as Hack 
        Club’s activities are primarily based in the United States. We, the organizers of EuroHacks, believe it is time to 
        address this gap. With this in mind, we are planning a hybrid, decentralized satellite hackathon across multiple 
        cities in Europe, scheduled for July 2025.

      title: Our vision for EuroHacks
      text: >
        <br> Creativity is a universal trait, and coding serves as a powerful medium for its expression. Through EuroHacks, we aim
        to unite individuals in the pursuit of developing remarkable projects that showcase their innovative potential. It is
        through the ingenuity and creative efforts of young minds that transformative change can be broughtabout in the world.

        <br><br>To foster greater inclusivity and accessibility, we are organizing EuroHacks as a series of decentralized 
        hackathons across Europe, allowing participants to engage without the need to travel beyond their respective 
        countries. Furthermore, the hybrid nature of the event enables individuals to join remotely from the comfort of 
        their homes, providing a unique opportunity to witness the creation of exceptional projects across the continent.

      title: Our awesome organizing team
      text: >
        <br> EuroHacks is organized by a team of high-schoolers from all over Europe united by the goal of allowing young 
        innovators to bring their ideas to life and be part of something greater. As most of us have been part of Hack Club 
        for years we know from inside that creating a community of young individuals interested in Computer science is very 
        beneficial for our community and them. Having programs from different parts of CS is what makes this community special. 
        That is something that all of us have experienced by participating in programs/hackathons/internships in Hack Club. 
        Our commitment to inclusion, access to technology, and creative collaboration drives us forward and is demonstrated 
        by our close collaboration over the past few months to create this complex and creative event.

  Hiya! Bartosz here, I'm just a Hack Clubber who wants to help out others as much as possible. I code 
  games and some fun tools in low level languages, though I prefer to spend my time doing tasks at Hack 
  Club. I love reading self-improvement books, and if I get bored - play some video games like Persona. 
  I just want to influence as many people as possible and make them acknowledge their skills, improve them!

organizers.Christos_Tsichrinis.bio: >
  My name is Christos Tsichrinis and I am a high school student from Trikala. I started programming during the pandemic
  and since then I have been involved in computer science both for competitions and for my fun.
  In my free time I usually read an extracurricular book or spend time with my pets. 
  Eurohacks is the first hackathon I am organizing and for this reason I am very excited and looking forward to it

  - question: What is a hackathon?
    answer: >
      A hackathon is an event where people interested in coding and computer science come together 
      for a few days to create fascinating projects, but more importantly, meet new people and learn 
      new things. Combined with amazing venues, food, drinks, and a good attitude, hackathons are a 
      wonderful experience and an unforgettable coding event.
      
  - question: Is there an age limit?
    answer: >
      This event is for teenagers, ideally ages 13 to 18, though technically it’s open to anyone 18 
      or under.

  - question: Do I have to speak English?
    answer: >
      No, you don't have to know English, but some English can help with navigating websites and 
      communicating with others during the hackathon.
      
  - question: How can I contact you if I have any questions about the events?
    answer: >
      Don’t hesitate to send us an email with all of your questions. We will answer them as soon as 
      possible (probably under 24 hours). You can either email at questions@eurohacks.org or in your 
      country email: <country>@eurohacks.org.
      
  - question: Do I have to pay to participate in the hackathon?
    answer: > # but even that depends on your location. If you live within 50km of the venue, you’ll need to cover your daily travel expenses to and from the venue. However, if you’re coming from a city further than 50km away, some of your travel expenses to the host city may be reimbursed. This means you may still need to pay some of the cost of your travel tickets.
      No, you don't. You just have to cover the travel stipends. 
      
  - question: What can I make for a project?
    answer: >
      Whatever you want if it is about computer science. It could be something with Arduino, Raspberry 
      Pi, or (something that you don’t have to get your hardware) coding. This could be website developing, 
      app developing, coding an Arduino, or making code which does something cool and something that 
      YOU are proud of.
      
  - question: Do I have to get a laptop with me?
    answer: >
      Yes. It is a coding event, you have to take any electronic device necessary to create your project 
      (it could be a tablet or a laptop) and the accessories that are necessary for you (eg charger, 
      hard disk, SD card, etc.). Perhaps we are able to make some laptops available to 1 or 2 people but 
      you must have provide for your own devices at the hackathon.
