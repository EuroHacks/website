            "question": "What is a hackathon?",
            "answer":   "A hackathon is an event where people interested in coding and computer science come together for a few days to create fascinating projects, but more importantly, meet new people and learn new things. Combined with amazing venues, food, drinks, and a good attitude, hackathons are a wonderful experience and an unforgettable coding event." 
        },
        {
            "question": "Is there an age limit?",
            "answer":   "This event is for teenagers, ideally ages 13 to 18, though technically it’s open to anyone 18 or under." 
        },
        {
            "question": "Do I have to speak English?",
            "answer":   "No, you don't have to know English, but some English can help with navigating websites and communicating with others during the hackathon." 
        },
        {
            "question": "How can I contact you if I have any questions about the events?",
            "answer":   "Don’t hesitate to send us an email with all of your questions. We will answer them as soon as possible (probably under 24 hours). You can either email at questions@eurohacks.org or in your country email: <country>@eurohacks.org." 
        },
        {
            "question": "Do I have to pay to participate in the hackathon?",
            "answer":   "No, you don't. You just have to cover the travel stipends but even that depends on your location. If you live within 50km of the venue, you’ll need to cover your daily travel expenses to and from the venue. However, if you’re coming from a city further than 50km away, some of your travel expenses to the host city may be reimbursed. This means you may still need to pay some of the cost of your travel tickets." 
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I participate in the event if I am not near the venue (or not even the host city)?",
            "answer":   "Whatever you want if it is about computer science. It could be something with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or (something that you don’t have to get your hardware) coding. This could be website developing, app developing, coding an Arduino, or making code which does something cool and something that YOU are proud of."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do I have to get a laptop with me?",
            "answer":   "Yes. It is a coding event, you have to get your devices (it could be a tablet or a laptop) so you can make your projects. We may be able to offer some laptops to 1 or 2 people but you have to get your own devices in the hackathon."
