## 1. Why do we want to organize EuroHacks?
Hack Club is an esteemed organization that brings together high school students from across the globe who share a deep passion for creation and innovation. Within Hack Club, a diverse group of individuals - ranging from organizers, coders, and hackers to painters, engineers, musicians, writers, and volunteers - unite to foster a dynamic community. This collaborative spirit is exemplified not only through the Hack Club Slack, where members engage and connect but also through hackathons.
Hackathons serve as an exceptional platform to gather individuals with a common enthusiasm for coding and creativity. They offer a unique space for collaboration, learning, and technological innovation while strengthening bonds within the Hack Club community.
However, despite Hack Club’s global presence, no hackathons are currently being held in Europe, as Hack Club’s activities are primarily based in the United States. We, the organizers of EuroHacks, believe it is time to address this gap. With this in mind, we are planning a hybrid, decentralized satellite hackathon across multiple cities in Europe, scheduled for 12 July 2025.


## 2. Our vision for EuroHacks
Creativity is a universal trait, and coding serves as a powerful medium for its expression. Through EuroHacks, we aim to unite individuals in the pursuit of developing remarkable projects that showcase their innovative potential. It is through the ingenuity and creative efforts of young minds that transformative change can be brought about in the world.
To foster greater inclusivity and accessibility, we are organizing EuroHacks as a series of decentralized hackathons across Europe, allowing participants to engage without the need to travel beyond their respective countries. Furthermore, the hybrid nature of the event enables individuals to join remotely from the comfort of their homes, providing a unique opportunity to witness the creation of exceptional projects across the continent.

## 3. Funding
Eurohacks is supported by Hack Club (fiscally sponsored), a non-profit organization in the USA. Eurohacks is a non-profit organization so we are only funded by donations. The money raised from donations will only go into organizing the hackathon. Donations play a crucial role in helping us create an inspiring and inclusive experience for all participants.
